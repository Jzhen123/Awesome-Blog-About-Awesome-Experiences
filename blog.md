##### How I felt jumping right into pit of despair at the beginning of the week.

I went through all of Justin's wonderful Onboarding videos, moved on to Pre Work Week One tasks and then BAM, I was instantly overwhelmed with all this new documentation about CLI, Git, and everything else.


I wasn't much of a reader throughout school so when I pulled up the documentation and tried to understand every single section I figured out quickly that this might not be how I learn.
