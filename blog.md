_**How I felt jumping right into pit of despair at the beginning of the week.**_

* I started this week out by going through all of Justin's wonderful Onboarding videos, moved on to Pre Work Week One tasks and then BAM, I was instantly overwhelmed with all this new documentation about CLI, Git, and everything else.

* I wasn't much of a reader throughout school so when I pulled up the documentation and tried to understand every single section I figured out quickly that this might not be how I learn.  

* I kinda figured out why I didn't read as much during school. It was because I learn best by going in and doing the task at hand. I always fail but having an objective while I reference back to documentation gives me a much clearer view on how exactly the knowledge is applied during a task.

* Overall, I was really happy with how this first week has gone. I have learned a ton about CLI and Git and the many many commands that they have. Also learned about the amazing tool that Github is. A big one that I really enjoy is Markdown and how seeing what I code translate to what the user actually sees is pretty neat.

* I hope to keep everyone updated in this journey with my Spring 2021 cohort :)
